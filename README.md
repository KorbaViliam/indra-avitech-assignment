# indra-avitech-assignment
The project implements assignment for Indra Avitech company.

# Architecture
Implemented Producer and Consumer classes for producing and consuming commands. Commands are implemented by Command 
design pattern, hence they are implementing Command interface to avoid code branching and differentiating between them.
Commands accessing the database through UserRepository. UserRepository is implemented by Signleton design pattern to 
avoid creation of more than one instances. User ID and GUID is generated by 
database we do not need add them to insert script.

## Build
Project is using Maven automation and dependency management tool, hence you can use following commands:
* mvn clean: Cleans the project by deleting the generated build artifacts and temporary files.
* mvn compile: Compiles the source code of the project.
* mvn test: Runs the tests for the project.
* mvn package: Packages the compiled code and resources into a distributable format, such as a JAR or WAR file.
* mvn install: Installs the packaged artifact into the local Maven repository, making it available for other projects 
to use as a dependency.
* mvn dependency:tree: Displays the project's dependency tree, showing all the dependencies and their transitive 
dependencies.
* mvn exec:java: Executes the main class of the project, assuming it is a Java application.
