# indra-avitech-assignment
The project implements assignment for Indra Avitech company.

# Architecture
Implemented Producer and Consumer classes for producing and consuming commands. Commands are implemented by Command
design pattern, hence they are implementing the Command interface to avoid code branching and differentiating between them.
Commands accessing the database through UserRepository. UserRepository is implemented by the Singleton design pattern to
avoid the creation of more than one instance. User ID and GUID are generated by
the database we do not need to add them to insert the script.

## Build
The project is using Maven automation and dependency management tool, hence you can use the following commands:
* mvn clean: Cleans the project by deleting the generated build artifacts and temporary files.
* mvn compile: Compiles the source code of the project.
* mvn test: Runs the tests for the project.
* mvn package: Packages the compiled code and resources into a distributable format, such as a JAR or WAR file.
* mvn install: Installs the packaged artifact into the local Maven repository, making it available for other projects 
to use as a dependency.
* mvn dependency:tree: Displays the project's dependency tree, showing all the dependencies and their transitive 
dependencies.
* mvn exec:java: Executes the main class of the project, assuming it is a Java application.
